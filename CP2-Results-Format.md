# Challenge Problem 2 Results Format
The results are stored in the file named adaptation_data.txt, placed in the folder named adaptation.
During one testing, each time when the codes receive one data(a tuple consisting of three floating numbers from the three channels) at one timestamp, the failure detection and adaptation will be performed. And it will generate three adapted values as the result.
For each result, the three adapted values, will be stored in a new line of the file, adaptation.txt mentioned above, separated by comma.
