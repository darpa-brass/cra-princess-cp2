# Challenge Problem 2 Results Format
The results for each test case are stored in the file named orientation_mode_#_adapted_data.txt, placed in the folder named adaptation.

The orientation specifies the orientation of the test case, the mode specifies the mode of the test case and the # specifies the number of the data set.

During one testing, each time when the code receives one data(a tuple consisting of three floating numbers from the three channels) at one timestamp, the failure detection and adaptation will be performed. And it will generate three adapted values as the result.
For each result, the three adapted values, will be stored in a new line of the file, named orientation_mode_#_adapted_data.txt mentioned above, separated by comma.
